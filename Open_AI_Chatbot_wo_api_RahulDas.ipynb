        "This project is a simple command-line chatbot built using the OpenAI Python API. The chatbot demonstrates how modern large language models (LLMs), such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), can be integrated into Python applications to simulate intelligent and natural conversations.\n",

        "The chatbot uses OpenAI’s Chat Completions API to process user inputs, generate relevant and human-like responses, and maintain conversational context throughout the interaction. Users can engage in a dynamic back-and-forth dialogue, ask questions, or discuss topics just like they would with a virtual assistant.\n",
